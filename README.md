# OVERVIEW
An EDA on Boston Crimes for JCDSOL-008 Capstone 2 Project 

This is an exploratory data analysis as part of the Purwadhika  JCDSOL-008 class Capstone 2 Project of Module 2. 

This EDA focuses on UCR Part One and Two crimes in Boston from January 2016 to December 2017, 
the years with complete entries along with a more in-depth analysis for the top 5 most prominent crimes in Boston

This analyst hopes to identify patterns through general analysis of the basic questions; 
the whats, wheres, and whens, and then proceed to narrow down the observation to the top 5 most frequent crimes in Boston. 

By the end of this EDA, this analyst hopes to provide insights and hopefully could provide actionable suggestions as an answer to the problems.

## Dataframe description:
