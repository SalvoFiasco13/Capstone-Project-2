This EDA focuses on UCR Part One and Two crimes in Boston from January 2016 to December 2017, 
the years with complete entries along with a more in-depth analysis for the top 5 most prominent crimes in Boston

the whats, wheres, and whens, and then proceed to narrow down the observation to the top 5 most frequent crimes in Boston.
